# Introduction

The Tools Ecosystem is a centralized repository for the open and transparent exchange of metadata about software tools and services in bioinformatics and life sciences.
It serves as the foundation for the sustainability of the diverse Tools Platform services, and for the interoperability between all these essential services (bio.tools [@usesDataFrom:Ison2019], BioContainers [@usesDataFrom:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx192], OpenEBench, Bioconda, WorkflowHub, usegalaxy.eu) and related resources outside of the ELIXIR Tools Platform (e.g. Bioschemas).

The goal of this project is to cross-compare and analyze the metadata centralized in the Tools Ecosystem to maintain high quality descriptions, together with the EDAM ontology [@providesDataFor:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113] linked used for many annotations of these resources. In order to achieve these goals we need to design tools and processes that detect curation bottlenecks, perform rigorous data cross-validation, and generate detailed reporting about potential issues and actionable items.

We present here in a first section the results of these analyses, and in a second section the methods and approach we used, before to discuss potential perspectives for improved monitoring and curation of the Tools Ecosystem metadata and EDAM, as well as the insights to the .

# Results

## EDAM usage in bio.tools

_a barplot specifying which proportion of each EDAM section is used in bio.tools_

_a barplot specifying which concepts of each section are most used for annotation in bio.tools_ 

## bio.tools annotation completeness

_a Venn diagram specifying which proportion of bio.tools is annotated with topics/operations/data/formats (can you do this with a Venn?)_

_an Upset diagram specifying which proportion of bio.tools is annotated with topics/operations/data/formats (can you do this with a Venn?)_

## Tool function signatures

_a plot of the proportion of validated complete function signatures in bio.tools_

_a listing of the top 10 most erroneous function signatures in bio.tools_

# Methods

To facilitate the analysis of the data extracted from the Tools Ecosystem and other resources, we decided to make them available in a SPARQL endpoint, a solution that enables the querying of RDF resources. The various resources uploaded to a GraphDB-based SPARQL endpoint include:
- the EDAM ontology [@providesDataFor:jon_ison_2020_3899895], available in its development version at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edamontology/edamontology/main/EDAM_dev.owl.
- the bio.tools contents [@providesDataFor:Ison2019], available on the Tools Platform Ecosystem git repository as a Turtle-formatted BioSchemas [@providesMethodFor:gray2017bioschemas] file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bio-tools/content/master/datasets/bioschemas-dump.ttl.
- (add something here about the WorkflowHub [@usesDataFrom:carole_goble_2021_4605654] dump provided by Johan and Alban).

The analysis of the data is performed using SPARQL queries, which are performed using a number of Jupyter notebooks. The various results are visualized using python libraries such as matplotlib and R packages.

# Perspectives

# Code availability

The code described to run the analyses and obtain the results presented here is freely available [on GitHub](https://github.com/bio-tools/biohackathon2022). The data collected are also freely available on the [Tools Ecosystem main repository](https://github.com/bio-tools/content/) and on the [EDAM repository](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/).
